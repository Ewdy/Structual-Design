### Structural Design Calculations - rev 0.3
## README.md

This is the top level of several folders containing calculations common to
structural design. The calculations consist primarily of Jupyter Notebooks.
There are a few MathCAD worksheets included which require the user to have
MathCAD software in order to use.
